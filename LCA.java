// Medium
// Given two nodes in a binary tree, find their lowest common ancestor.

// Assumptions

// There is no parent pointer for the nodes in the binary tree

// The given two nodes are guaranteed to be in the binary tree

// Examples

//         5

//       /   \

//      9     12

//    /  \      \

//   2    3      14

// The lowest common ancestor of 2 and 14 is 5

// The lowest common ancestor of 2 and 9 is 9
